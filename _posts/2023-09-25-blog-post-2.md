# 《High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models》

### drawback of current method:
- GAN: mode-collapse & does not easily scale to model complex, multi-modal distributions. 
- auto-regressive transformer: computationally expensive
- DMs: computationally expensive

思路：
rate-distortion trade-off -> divide into two stage: perceptual compression stage(auto-encoder) & semantic compression stage(diffusion)

why pixel based representations of images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency details? 
Answers from new bing:
```
Pixel-based representations of images are composed of discrete units of color information, called pixels, that are arranged in a grid. Each pixel has a fixed size and location, and can only take one of a finite number of possible values. This means that pixel-based representations have inherent limitations in capturing the continuous and infinite variations of natural scenes.

One of these limitations is the loss of high-frequency details, which are the fine-grained features and textures that make an image look sharp and realistic. High-frequency details are often barely perceptible to the human eye, but they can have a significant impact on the quality and fidelity of an image. For example, high-frequency details can help distinguish different materials, such as hair, fur, skin, or metal, or convey subtle expressions, such as wrinkles, pores, or freckles.

However, pixel-based representations of images cannot preserve all the high-frequency details of the original scene, because they have a finite resolution and bit depth. Resolution is the number of pixels per unit area, and bit depth is the number of bits used to encode each pixel value. Higher resolution and bit depth can capture more high-frequency details, but they also require more storage space and computational resources. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the amount of information (rate) and the fidelity (distortion) of a pixel-based representation.

# 《PRO-Face: A Generic Framework for Privacy-preserving Recognizable Obfuscation of Face Images》
privacy-utility trade-off
- first process a face image using any preferred obfuscation, then leverage a Siamese network to generate the final image, original image & pre-obfuscated image are fed into fusion network simultaneously
- pre-trained recognizer也能对anonymized image有很好的识别效果，并且可以在原始图像和匿名图像之间进行识别
- **从对抗方法(Adversarial Approaches)和图像隐写(Image Steganography)获得灵感**
- $\mathcal{L}_{total}=\lambda_{1}\mathcal{L}_{ID} + \lambda_{2}\mathcal{L}_{Visual} + \lambda_{3}\mathcal{L}_{L1}$ Identity loss & Image loss are triplet loss, and using $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ to constrain image similarity in pixel level.
### triplet loss
$\mathcal{L}=max(d(a, p) - d(a, n) + margin,0)$

在一个三元组中包含anchor, positive sample, negative sample。

$margin$用来控制anchor与negative之间的距离

经常用在细粒度分类任务中，因为这类任务中的物体类别非常多，导致softmax所需要的计算量非常大。

缺点是收敛比较慢，并且容易overfit。

# 《Protecting Celebrities from DeepFake with Identity Consistency Transformer》
a face forgery detection method
Motivation:

- Most existing methods aim to discriminate fake images by exploiting low-level textures and searching for the underlying generation artifacts, which cause two common problems:(1) 这些方法经常只会被用在检测可疑的视频上，而这些视频的图像都有退化的现象；(2)对于很逼真的伪造图像的检测效果不好。所以想要一种可以大量使用语义信息的检测方法。
- 现有的模型大多只利用inner face的信息，但outer face的信息也很重要。

Method:

- focus on the identity discrepancy
- a new consistency loss
- 在patch的两头分别加入inner token和outer token，将transformer提取出来的inner face和outer face的信息分别放入到这两个token中，再对对这两个token分别做处理。
- 使用**cosine-based softmax loss**
- 设计了一个reference set作为库查询，其中包含许多real face的$feature_{in}$和$feature_{out}$对，在检测时将input face的inner face feature与reference set中特征进行比对，找到距离最近的$feature_{in}$，再通过比较outer face feature来获得$D_{out}$，以此类推获得$D_{in}$

Limitation:

- 对face reenactment的结果检测效果不佳（因为这个方法是基于inner face和outer face之间identity discrepancy，但face reenactment的目的在于保持原图像的特征）

  ``````latex
  Face Reenactment is an emerging conditional face synthesis task that aims at fulfilling two goals simultaneously: 1) transfer a source face shape to a target face; while 2) preserve the appearance and the identity of the target face.
